# Heavy_Machines
This project automates web scraping, storage, and management of heavy construction equipment data. It extracts names, models, and specifications using HTML and JSON parsing, handling pagination and category-based extraction. Data is stored in an SQLite database with separate tables for each manufacturer and category. The system enables automated updates, error handling, and database management functions. Use cases include market analysis, inventory management, and cost estimation, with future plans for machine learning integration, API development, and dashboards.
